Packages and scripts developed during my research internship at CA.

1- Interpreter_toolbox is a package developed to explain different models. Exemple_interpret_toolbox.ipynb is an exemple of how to use the toolbox, and the expected 
results

2- Benchmark_deep_with4-datasets.ipnyb can be used to reproduce the results of our benchmark of a neural nerwork architecture, applied to tabular data, and compared 
to tree based algorithm

3- AutoDl_script_complete.ipynb is an end-to-end script to use our AutoDL toolbox.
